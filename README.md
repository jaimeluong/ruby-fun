# Ruby Fun

Just a place to store the miscellaneous Ruby code I write as well as to store any notes I have while taking the [Learn Ruby](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby) course from Codecademy, because I need more practice before diving into learning Rails.

Fork and clone this repo, then everything should be able to be run from the command line.

```
$ cd ruby-fun
$ ruby <Ruby file here>
```
